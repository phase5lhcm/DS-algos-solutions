/**
 * Given a string S, we can transform every letter individually to be lowercase or uppercase to create another string.
 * Return a list of all possible strings we can create.
 * 
 * Questions to consider:
 *  Does the string only contain alphanumeric characters?
 *  Does the string contain duplicates?
 *  Is the output the same length of the input?
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * S = "a1b2"
 * Output = ["a1b2", "a1B2", "A1b2", "A1B2"]
